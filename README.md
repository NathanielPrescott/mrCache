## What is mrCache?
_______________

The goal of mrCache is to allow for fast setup and integration with a microservice built to handle redis caching. 
Aside from the time spent starting up the redis server and mrCache, the majority of setup should be done with integrating with mrCache's API.
The cache will have a gRPC interface first and I may look at adding a REST interface later on if there is a need for it.

## Building mrCache
_______________

I've built with the following versions.

    Rust: 1.74.0
    Redis: 7.2
    Docker: 24.0.7

Add build instructions.
